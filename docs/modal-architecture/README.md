# Modal Sandbox Architecture Docs

This directory contains Modal-specific architecture guidance for the DreamCore‑V2 sandbox migration.
It intentionally avoids product‑specific UX details and focuses on Modal design patterns, security,
I/O, and operational considerations. Use it alongside the DreamCore‑V2 product docs.

## Contents
- MODAL-SANDBOX-ARCHITECTURE.md — design patterns and recommended architecture
- QUICK-REFERENCE.md — day‑to‑day commands and operational checks
